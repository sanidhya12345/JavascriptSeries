Data types can be divided into two:

1.Primitive data types
2.Non-primitive data types(Object References)

Primitive Data Types:-

1.Numbers- Integers,Floats
2.Strings-Any data under single quotes,double quotes or backtick quotes
3.Booleans-true or false value
4.Null-empty or no value
5.Undefined-a declared variable without a value
6.Symbol-A unique value that can be generated by symbol constructor


Non-primitive Data Types:-

1.Objects
2.Arrays

->Primitive data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it.

->Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created.
